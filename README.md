The following are some of my projects from throughout the year:

## Adventure Game

I constructed a non-linear choose your own adventure game with multiple endings! Features included custom classes and objects that affect gameplay, plus amateur ASCII art!


## Study Application

I created a study application tool that displayed both terms and matching definitions. 


## Trivia Game

I created a game version of my study application that displayed the terms and definitions as a question, requring player input. The game told the player whether they were right or wrong and even gave them a total score at the end.
